# Projects
##### (*Project 2 is omitted due to the end product not being representative of what I consider to be a finished product.)


## Project 1: Arrange

#### This project was my first introduction to UX design and wireframing. It was my first attempt at low-mid fidelity mockups and exposure to Adobe XD.
#### The end product is supposed to be an additional, but independent, feature for CSU Northridge's horrendous portal app for students. Its purpose is to make academic appointments  easier to schedule and navigation more intuitive for its users. 
#### The research aspect of this project was the most prioritized over the UI. 


## Project 3: AirBnBeyond

#### Project 3 is a school project themed around IOT. It is an expansion of AirBnB's services and perks rewarded to exclusive members that show customer loyalty. 
#### The AirBnBeyond membership is modeled after Amazon's Prime membership + perks/rewards system that promotes a symbiotic relationship between buyer and seller, creating perpetual benefits to both ends.
##### ABnB Credit Card, Rewards Points, Smart Locks
#### While this was a group project requiring collective effort, my contribution went towards most of the research stage of development.
#### My responsibilities:
##### Find AirBnB statistics in users.
##### Smartlock statistics and market/industry data
##### User Flow, Sustainability Plans, Future Plans
